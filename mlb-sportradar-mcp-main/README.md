## Usage

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop

First, install the MCP CLI globally:

```bash
uv tool install "mcp[cli]"
```

Then add this server to your Claude Desktop configuration file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MLB SportRadar": {
      "command": "/Users/<USERNAME>/.local/share/uv/tools/mcp/bin/mcp",
      "args": ["run", "/full/path/to/mlb-sportradar-mcp/src/mlb_sportradar_mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/full/path/to/` with the actual absolute path to your `mlb-sportradar-mcp` directory.

Restart Claude Desktop after saving the configuration.

### 2. Use the MCP server with Claude

## Development and testing

Install development dependencies and run the test suite with:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
pytest -v tests
```

### Running the server locally

To start the server manually (useful when developing or testing), run:

```bash
mlb-sportradar-mcp
```

Alternatively, you can run it directly with:

```bash
uv run python src/mlb_sportradar_mcp/server.py
```

### Installing MCP CLI globally

If you want to use `mcp run` commands, install the MCP CLI globally:

```bash
uv tool install "mcp[cli]"
```

Then you can run:

```bash
mcp run src/mlb_sportradar_mcp/server.py
```
